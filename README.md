Hi,

This is a jewellery online shop 'Moon Ruby Shop' for an existing amazing Etsy shop "https://www.etsy.com/shop/MoonRubyShop". Go check it! 

To build it I used new tools for me like Next.js and Stripe Payment API (it's now in test mode), and also utilised Firebase/ Firestore for creating collections in db and 'store-owner' authentication, Cloudinary API to upload images and store them, Bootstrap and CSS to style.

Features available to all users: shopping, adding to cart, modifying cart, proceeding to checkout, buying. 

Extra features available only to shop-owner: dashboard with paid orders, possibility to add listing, modify fields, add/ delete images, delete listing, register new users. 

Features and everything to be updated.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
